# Semantic Search Frontend Service

Welcome to the frontend service of my semantic search project.
To start this project a few preparations are needed:
* Install python and the flask library
* Set the configurations in the config.py
* To change the host to localhost adjust the run file

After this is done, you can start the service with the command 
```shell
bash run
```

### Problems:
The backend has to be configured properly and has to be running. Please make sure all instructions in 
the backend service are resolved.
